SUMMARY = "Tools for zmodem/xmodem/ymodem file transfer"
DESCRIPTION = "Lrzsz is a cosmetically modified zmodem/ymodem/xmodem package built\n\
from the public-domain version of Chuck Forsberg's rzsz package.\n\
.\n\
These programs use error correcting protocols ({z,x,y}modem) to send\n\
(sz, sx, sb) and receive (rz, rx, rb) files over a dial-in serial port\n\
from a variety of programs running under various operating systems."
