SUMMARY = "Python module used in SELinux policy generation"
DESCRIPTION = "The sepolgen library is structured to give flexibility to the application \
using it. The library contains: Reference Policy Representation, \
which are Objects for representing policies and the reference policy \
interfaces. Secondly, it has objects and algorithms for representing \
access and sets of access in an abstract way and searching that \
access. It also has a parser for reference policy "headers". It \
contains infrastructure for parsing SELinux related messages as \
produced by the audit system. It has facilities for generating policy \
based on required access."
